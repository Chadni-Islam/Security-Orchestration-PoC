# Security-Orchestration-PoC
we present a Proof of Concept (PoC) SOAR platform that we have designed and implemented based on the proposed architectural approach. The functional requirements of our PoC are to automate the process of integrating security tools, automate the selection of security tools to execute an IRP and automate the execu-tion of a set of IRPs. We designed the PoC in a way so that it can easily be evolved with dynamic changes. In this implementation, we considered two types of changes that are most common is SOARs execution environment â€“ change in security tools and change in IRPs. We analyzed the instruction of integration and orchestration to select the technologies and identify the design decisions. We designed automated integration processes and selected semantic technologies to enable semantic integration and interpretation of security tools data.
